                    Antimo Marrazzo is a computational condensed-matter physicist and materials scientist working on the theory and simulation of materials, with a focus on topological insulators, two-dimensional materials and electronic-structure theory. He obtained his BSc and MSc in Physics cum laude at University of Trieste (Italy) in 2013 and 2015 respectively, with a thesis on the Local Properties of the Orbital Magnetization, the Anomalous Hall Effect and the Localization Tensor in Magnetic Metals.
                    In October 2015 he moved to the group of Nicola Marzari at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) where got his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering in November 2019, with a thesis on Electronic Structure and Topology of Novel Materials, winning the 2020 EPFL Doctoral Program Thesis Distinction (awarded to the 8% best PhD thesis), the SAIS prize 2021 (best STEM PhD 2021 among Italian-speaking doctoral students in Switzerland) and the Wasserman Award 2021 (for innovative and high-level research in the field of new materials). He stayed at EPFL as a post-doc with Nicola Marzari until 2020 and in April 2021 he started as a junior assistant professor (RTDa) at the Physics Department of University of Trieste. He has 14 publications, more than half as first-author, including 4 Physical Review Letters, 2 Nano Letters, 2 npj Computational Materials, 1 npj 2D Materials and Applications, and 1 Nature Nanotechnology, with more than 1500 citations and an h-index of 10 (source Web of Science).
					In January 2022 he attained the Italian national scientific habilitation (ASN) as associate professor in theoretical condensed matter physics (FIS/03 - 02/B2).
